# 1. Create a new script in your r-davis-in-class-yourname project named week_4_assignment_ABC.R but with your initials in place of ABC. Save it to your scripts folder.

# 2. Read portal_data_joined.csv into R using the read.csv command and create a dataframe named surveys (just like we did in class).

library(readr)
surveys <- read_csv("data/portal_data_joined.csv")

# 3. Subset to just the first column and columns five through 8. Include only the first 400 rows. Save this as a dataframe called  surveys_subset.

surveys_subset <- surveys[c(1:400),c(1,5:8) ]

# 4. CHALLENGE: Select all rows that have a hindfoot_length greater than 32, save these in a new data.frame named  surveys_long_feet, then plot its hindfoot_length values as a histogram using the hist function.

surveys_long_feet <- surveys_subset[surveys_subset$hindfoot_length>32,]
View(surveys_long_feet)

# 5. Change the column hindfoot_lengths into a character vector.

hindfoot_lengths <- as.character(surveys_long_feet$hindfoot_length)

# 6. Plot the hindfoot_lengths in a histogram (if this doesnâ€™t work, just leave it, and think about it during Part II of the assignment, wink wink).

hist(hindfoot_lengths) #vector doesn't work b/c it's a character
hist(surveys_long_feet$hindfoot_length) #column in data frame works b/c it's still numeric

# 7. Commit & Push the R script to GitHub - check your repository on GitHub and make sure your script is there.
